## This is  Aloha Website includes `HTML/CSS/jQuery`. I have used CSS Box Model , Flex, Lists, anchor tags, Background images, font-face , Font-Awesome, Responsive Designs. and the most amazing `jQuery`. I used swal library to pop-up, increasing counter when user adds item to cart(jquery) and smooth scrolling when user clicks at links in navigation bar.
